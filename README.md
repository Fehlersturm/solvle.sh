# solvle.sh
a wordle solver in .sh
i did this just so that i dont have to play wordle anymore.
it is messy and shows my lacking understanding of regex. and refusal to adapt any kind of style. but it does work

# Usage
cd to dir 
./solvle.sh

# Features
search through a dictionary with grep. some filtering and sorting available.
